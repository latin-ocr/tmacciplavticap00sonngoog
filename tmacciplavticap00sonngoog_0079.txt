This MS, which scholare have agreed sinos Ritschl to designate
by the letter J, is at present little known, and its velue a dehatcd -
question. Ritschl, in his Prolegomena to tha Trinummus, p. xli
(1848), accorded it an equal rank with the Codex Vetus (B),
Wagner, who first published a collation, for his edition 01 160
Aulularia (1866), expresssd an adverse opinion, and challenged the
position which Ritschl had assigned it in his stamma Since
Wagners Aulularia was published, several writers have discussed
the question, and arrived Ι01 various results. I propose to give
some account 01 this controversy, and 1ο 01010 the conclusion
to which I have been lad from a consideration of tha arguments
advauced on both sides, and my own examinetion of the MS.

For a description 01 J and its history I will refer the render 10
Wagner’s Introduction* to which the following remarks may be
regarded as supplementary. Itis neatly executed, apparently by
more than one hand; few contractione are employed, end the writ-
ing is on tha whole easy 10 read, exceptiug where it has been
damaged bythe fire. It has, however, been so severely burnt all

round the edge, that nearly tha whole 01 the margin is destroyed, ,

and the beginnings 01 11000 onthe 1011, and ends 01 11000 00 the
right hand pagcs, end sometimes a line or two at the tops 01 peges,
are more or less illegible. The MS. thus injured hasbeen re-
paired 00 inlaid, the parts destroyed having been replaced by new
parchment, 00 as to complete the original size 01 the pagos, aud 10
preserve the whole from further iujnry.

The facsimile specimen, containing apassaga from Capt. 1111, is
taken 100ιο the bottom 01 a folio, and will serve 10 give soma idea of
the appearance 01 the MS. : the heading 01 the new scene is in red
letters, and also the capital letter M. On the right hand side tha

⁴* I would at the same time point out a slight mistake into which Wagner has
fallen. 'Phe quotation which he gives from Gasley (p. 316), 10 the effect thatthe
MS. ‘was preserved,' 0010001000 entirely different volume-one in the Oottonian
Library. There can 60 00 doubt that our MS. was injured in the fire which 60001

every appearance 01 having suffered by 100; and Oasley's words, ‘lacerata sunt
aliqua folia 10 principio codicis,’ apply sufficiently well 10 11, being intended 10

Casley’s descriptione are sornewhat vagae and general.
