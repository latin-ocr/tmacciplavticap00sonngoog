SOUROES OF THE TEXT.

The MSS. of importance which conmin the Captivi are:

(1) Tm (lodex Vetus (B), a MS. of the llth century, now
in the Vatican Library at Rome. It was originally discovered
in the middle of the sixteenth century by the great German
scholar J oachim Camerarius, and is the main authority on
which the text of Plautus rests. It conmins all the twenty
comedies. , The original reading of B has been in many places
corrected by several hands of various ages, the most important

being the so-called “ raaaas arcuada?
(2) The Codex Britannicus (J), a MS. also of the end of

until the discovery of the Codex Vetus by Camerarius.

(4) The Codex Ambrosianus (A), a palimpsest now in the
Ambrosian library at Milan: The original MS. of Plautus
belonged probably to the 5th century, and if it were preserved
entire at the present day, would be an authority of paramount
importanee upon the text of the whole of Plautus; but in the
9th century it was taken to pieces, and ruthlessly washed and ’
scraped3 upon the parchment thus prepared a copy of the
Vulgata was made. The original writing is therefore exceed-
ingly hard to decipher, and about two-thirds of the leaves are
entirely lost. Ostha Captivi, all that cau be read are a few
