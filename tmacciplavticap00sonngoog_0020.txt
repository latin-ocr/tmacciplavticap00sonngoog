Nora ΤΟ THE Nn'w EDITION.

ΙΝ the form in which this book now appears, Ι have added
an Excursus upon the MS. J, and the Appendix which Ι
announced as in preparation last autumn, containing Bentley's
emendations upon the other plays 01 Plautus. Ι have further
reprinted (p. 162) from the Classical Journal 01 the year 1812,
alist 01 Bentley's books now in the British Museum, and all
containing MS. notes by him. This list, 01 the existence 01
which I only receutly became aware, Ι have completed,·with
the help 01 the Museum Catalogue: it will, I hope, give a
tolerably correct idea 01 the rich treasure of Bentleiana, which
still lies unedited in our national Museum.* Ihave also added
⁵ (p. 161) alist 01 the readings which I have been 'able to restore

in J from Bentley’s ccllaticn 01 the MS. (See Pref. p. wi, note). ’

Το my text Ι have added the numbers of the lines in
Fleckeisen's edition My Oritioal Apparatus is now rendered
more complete and consistent by the addition 01 the readings
01 D in a number of passages communicated to me since last

¹ autumn hy Prol. Studemund (marked 8), and by 0 second

collation ofJ, made by Dr. L. Α P. Schroeder. I am further
indebted 10 E. M. Thcmpscn, Esq, Keeper of MSS. in the

Museum, 101 several hints with regard 10 my Excursus ; and
to the great kindness 01 my friend, A W. Κ. Miller, Esq, MA,

Fellow 01 University Collega, London‚ who gave me valuahle ,

assistance during a period 01 very hard work in the Museum.¹
I would call the attention 01 the reader 10 the note on
page 2 (Introduction).
