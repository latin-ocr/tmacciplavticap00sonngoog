, they arsin the main translated from the notes of Dr. Brix on
the Captivi (3rd ed, 1876), and thelhinummus (and ed, 1873),
where reference was made to that play in a note on the Cap·
tivi. But Ι have not hesitated to omit or abridge many of his
annotatione, or to add others of my own, where I thought
that by so doing Ι should make this edition more suitable for
the class of readers for which it is intended. My own addi-
tions Ι have, so far as possible, distinguished by square
brackets. Here, again, ·Ι desire to acknowledge my obli·
gations to the notes on the Captivi by Ussing, as well as to
ι several articles by Geppert, Lorenz, and other scholars in
various periodioal publicatione. Ι have been able to adopt
the view of F. Martins (Quaestiones Plautinae, Berlin, 1879)
as to the absence of the two ‘Captivos' from the stage during
the first Act.

The seetion of the Introduction which treats of the Prosody
of Plautus, Ι have translated and abridged from the “‚Einlei-
tung'' to the 'lrinummue by Dr. Brix (2nd ed.,1873); for the
laet paragraph on Hiatus at tho end of this section, I am
myself responsible.

In conclusion, Iwould say that there is probably no play
of Plautus or Terence so suitable for school reading as the
Captivi Whether or not we accept the judgment of Iessing,
who considered it to be the best play of its kind ever produced
on the stage* all must agree that it abeunds in humour and
interest, and is at the same time particularly free from that
grossnese which makes Plautus a difficult subject to read with

aclass. The boast of the Epilogus is on the whole well ¹ .

justified:

mit den librigen zufalligen Soho'nheiten reiuhlieh versehen ist.''
