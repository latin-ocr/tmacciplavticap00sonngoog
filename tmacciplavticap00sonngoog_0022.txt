xiv 0000000 00 rur 0000.

100000 in two passages (lv 3. 5-v 1. 12, and v 4. 26 10 tho
end).

Of the MSS. above mentioned, a 0011011000 01 Band J * is given
in the Critical Apparatus of this edition; 000001000οΙ reference
is made to D, and the fragments· of readings which have
hitherto been deciphered in A are added. The first and se'·
’ cond hands in B are distinguished as B1 and B² respectively.
Other MSS. of lesser importanoe, when mentioned, are alluded
to as Codices Minores. .

The text of this edition may be presumed to contain the
reading of the MSS. B aad J, unless a variation is noted in
the Oritioal Apparatus.

In the Oriticel Apparatus, the readings of editors who have
proposed corrections of the MSS, 000 given only in cases

⁴* Mere variationsinspelling are not usually indicated, especially where
they represent the customary orthography of the Ms. in question. Thus
inJ there are hardly any capitals, 0011000 stands foro (e. g. 000000),10000
(prelia), 100 i (000. plna), for a (edendi); i stands for e (intelligo), for 0
(optimas, surripuit), fory (Tiadmas); o for u (edobeccns); a foro (0000000,
taum), though the older spelling, e. g. 0000000, 10 occasionally fonnd; y for
i (Phylocrutes); 0 for t (e. g. precio, nuncius), and conversely t for 0 (offa-
tiia); 00 fors (exspectet); b is often inserted (barus, bodio, bostiam cf. on
the other hand, Epio for Hegio) ς d and a are assimilated to a following
letter (assidam, attinet, affero, allapsam, irapmatam, immittere, irrepado);
-a est, -e eat, -i est, -o ast, -arm est, -00 est, 000 written in full, instead cf the
contractions, -ust, -ust, -amst, etc. ; 001 and 00100 stand 100 quoi and quoius
owni for quom : mibi and nibil 000 generally written michi and nichil, and
0010 constantly confused with e (e. g. 100101, sepe, aegane); further, 0 pre·
position is usually written as part of the word which it governs (e. g.
inmanitate, odic, intense), and other words are similarly joined (e. g. 101000,
sipotcs). But these peculiarities 000 not noted excepting for some special
reasons Nor have I thought it worth while to register 011 1100 vagaries
of J in the matter of the speakers to whom lines 000 attributed. In
12. 73-81, for instance, the greatest confusion prevails. Again, it has
been impossible, without greatly extending the compass of the 00111001
Apparatus, to indicate 0111100 passages in which J is illegible: this 10
only done where 0 wrong conclusion might have been drawn ‘ex silentio!
(1οο00011000 made by a second hand are always given with the words ‘by
second hand ;’ 0 word corrected immediately by the first hand 10 some·
times simply given 00 11 was meant to stand, but generally the fact that
0 correction has been made is noted-It should be added 11001 11 10 only.
in the case 01 J that this edition gives firsthand inforrnation. The sources
from which my statements 00 10 Β 000 taken are indicated in the Preface.
