Bentley's emendations of Plautus are made upon 1110 text of
Parcus* (and edition, Frankfurt, 1623, 0 re-issue 01 the and edition
01 Neustadt, 1619), and in ink 01 two distinctly different periods

and 00101110. The notes in fainter ink are far less frequent, occur· .

also suggested in darker ink in the text and margin on the right and

left of the page. 11 seems that Bentley made his first few eorrec-

tions at the foot 01 the page, aud on 010101 and more complete study ,

repeated some of them among his maturer thoughts in the margin.
Besides these emendations 01 the text, which are found in greater 01
1000 number in all the plays, Bentley has added in the so-oalled first
eight comedies the chief variants of the Codex Britannicus (J), 10
which he generally appende the letters Md, contrary, however, to
his usual went, he nowhere states what Me. it 10 that he iscollatiug.
In 111000 eight plays all conjectural emendations 010 enclosed in
brackets with the word lep. In other plays he as 0 rule omits this

Of these corrections the large majority archis own conjectures,

does not indicate specially which 01 the corrections are taken from

to the world 01 1110 present day ,· many have been independently
made since his time by Lindemann, Bothe,† Bitschl, Fleckeisen,
Brix and others: indeed, it is surprising to find how much 01 the
Plautina criticism 01 the present century is anticipated in this un-
known copy of Parcus. After deducting the corrections which belong
to the two classes just mentioned, 111010 remain a considerable
number which are entirely new and often of the highest value and
interest, it is precisely the more recherche thoughts of Bentley
which others have not had 1110 good fortune to light upon inde-
