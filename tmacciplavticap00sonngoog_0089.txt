where Bentley deletes 000111, Ι have indicated the correction by
writing 111001 mem] Erem,· in Trin. 1 2. 14, where Bentley deletes
baec, I write 11000 aalma] 001010. In choosing between the word
that precedes the one 10 be omitted and that which follows it‚I
have preferred the mode 01 indication which seemed to'give the
most information, and¹ to make the correction, 00 101 00 possible,
explain 110011 Mnch insight may be gained from a mere study of
lists drawn up in this manner, into Bentley’s methods 01 conjecturat
emendation Thus in the 101101 passage it would also have been
possible 10 give tibi 1000] 1111111111 this would have done little, apert
from the text, 10 100011 one how such emendations are made. Simi-
larly with 0111111100 made by Bentley to the text. Here the word
· after 01 before which the insertion 10 10 be made appears on the left
011110 bracket, and on the right the same repeated, with Bentley's
addition5 sometimes it seemed worth while to give the teeo words
between which the new word was 10 be inserted 3 thus in Rud. 11

. 3. 6, e's eat] ie iprae eat. 110οο0100011γῖ101001101010111011( or

explanation 01 my own, which then always appears between another
pair 01 square brackets.

The signs which Bentley employa are the following. In deleting
he either writes d (10. 101.) in the margin, and puts dots under the
letters to be removed, or sometimes simply strikes them out in the
10111, with or without the addition 01 d in the margin. The latter
less elaborate method he usually follows in words in Roman type
(which are conjecturat additions adopted by Parcus, the rest of his
text being in italics); sometimes he employa it to remove italice.
In making additions he employs the caret, and writes the word 10
be inserted in the margin, in transposing words he uses figures,
sometimes in 1110 margin with a curved line in the text (thus

trcrrrme'ttcree {Timaei-effi] 12), sometimes in the text itself. In

correcting aword or part of a word, he underlines 1110 part 10 bc
corrected, and writes the correction in the margin3 thus Epid. 1 2. 27
mandante] 001011 11 2. 116 Q] lebena

Teii-rdicate the end of a verse, he employs en upright line, which
he introduces into the text This I have simply reprodnced, as 1110
simplest way 01 representing the correction, adding the word after
which it stands on the 101101 a bracket: thus Cas. 1115. 18 Por-
10111011, 01, Epid 11 2. 26 rotas] lep. Ι. Occasionally we find
aword underlined, apparently 101 correction, but without any emen·
dation being suggested. Finally, Bentley employa a sort of tick in
the margin, sometimes applying to awhole line, sometimes 10 0 part
