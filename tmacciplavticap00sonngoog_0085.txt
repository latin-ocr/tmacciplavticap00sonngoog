In the latter instances we may safely pronounce J superior, with-
out the support of D. Who theu can deny the importunae of J in
those parts of Plautus in which itis the only means oi controlliug
Bl So far from its being true, as the revicwer in the Philologischcr
Anzciger says, that, in the absence of the support of D, a reading of
J carries scarcely any authority, it appears that itis precisely in
these cases that the importauce of J is greatest ; though of course
it would come with even more authority if supported by D.

On the other hand, there are limite to the claime of J. On the
whole, the passages in which help is given by J are those in which
the corruption in Bis not very serious. If we compare these pas·
sagos with some of those in which A throws a flood of light upon a
hopelessly corrupt passage in B, wc see at once the immensurable ·
· distance which separatos the two cases ; whereas in passages in which
B presents a deep-seated corruption, J (and l may add D) usually
gives no help. The following references may serve as instances:
Prol. 22, 58, 1 1. 17, ι l. 34-39, 11 l. 7, ιιι l. 19, v 1. 7. These
identical errore must be ascribed to the common archetype of BD
and J, and prove conclusivaly the close relation in which they all
three stand ιο -one another. We must accordingly not expect from
J the sort of help that comes from a MS. representing an altogether
older tradition, such as A 5 but the help given by J is similar and
equal to the help given by D. ¹From a compar-ison of B with D and
J, we may sometimes be able ιο infer the reading of their common
archetype (h), which, if we possessed it, would perhaps be of equal
velue with A. ,

It remeius briefly to consider the question of the similarity ofJ

’ ιο the later MSS, upon which an indictment against the former has

been founded. This similarity is in general, nc doubt, striking, but
itin nowise diminishes the authority of J, the only legitimate infer-
ence being that all these MSS. belong to the same family* Accord-
ingly, where they contain a reading superior to B, the agreement
ofJ simply lenda the authority of age to the reading of the later
MSS. Itis douhtless true that, owing to this close relation, early
editors were in many passages enabled to correct the reading of Β
from the minor MSS, independently of the help of J ; but this does
not really detract from the velue of a MS. of the llth centnry‚†
though I venture to think that it has been one of the causes why J

⁴ Positive evidence has recently been produced by uun of the existence of two
older Mas. of the family of J : (1) a Ms. of somewhat earlier data than the lith
century, of which a fragment only (capt. 113. dit-m 4. 22) has been preserved
in the (lodex ottobonianus (see Anal. Plaut. pp. 86, 87) ; this fragment exhibitsa '
great similarity to J both in its readings (see effractrnn, 111 1. 6, for ecfertum) and
in the contractione and spelling employed, though enclitics and proclitics are not
so frequently joined to their respective words as in J ς (2) ans. of the 13th cen-
tury (a), now in the Ambrosian hibrary, containing the first eight plays, and
presenting a close resemblance to J, though clearly not copied from it (sce an article
by uun and dee in the Rheinisehes Murcum for 1879, p. 52).

† For example, the reading which J preservee in 111 5. 108 and ιιι 2. 13 is not
any lese valuahle because other and later MSS. also preserve it.
