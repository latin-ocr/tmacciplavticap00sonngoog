readings. Ι have been able, however, to make avalnable addi·
tion to my Oritioal Apparatus, iu 6 considerable number of
emendations by Richard Bentley, which are here published for
⁴ the first time. These I found in the British Mecum, written
in the margin of a copy of Peneus (Press Mark‚ 6821110). A
comparison of these notes with other specimens of Bentley’s
handwriting leaves no doubt whatever that they are really
Bentley's own. But the best proof of their genuineness is
furnished by the readings themselves, which could only have
prooeeded from a scholar of Bentley’s oalibre. In one passage
(111 5. 66, 67) the marginal correction is identioal with one
proposed in Bentley's edition of Terence* These readings I
. have further, in the majority of cases, introduced into my text ;
which, neverthelesS, will be found 86 be on the whole con·
siderably nearer the MSS. even than that of Dr. Brirr. In this
part of my work I have derived great assistance from the Criti-
cal Appendix of Dr. Brix and the notes of Ussing (16111,
Havniae, 1878); besides these, I have used the editions of
Iindemann (Leipzie 1830), Weise (Quedh'nburg, 1847-48),
Fleckeisen (V ol. I., stereotyped ed, Leipzic, first pubhshed in
1850), and Geppert (tertiemus), the “Plautinische Pro·
sodie'' of Miiller (Berlin, 1869), the “Metrik der Grieohen
und Bdmer'' of Christ (Leipsic, 1879), and the work of Α,

’ Spengel on Plautus (“Kritik‚ Prosodie, Metrik,'' thtingen,

1865). My special thanks are due to Professor W. Studemund,
of Strassburg, who most kindly sent me information as to the
readings of the Vatican MSS. (B and D) in some 66666111 which
6 doubt or difficulty arose.

With regard to the explanatory notes at the end of the book,

⁴* Many of these emendations have since been independently made by
other scholare, among whom I may mention Lindemann, Fleckeisen, and
Dr. Brix. But among some fifty-three corrections in the Captivi, less

than one third, and these for the most part the more obvious ones,
are adopted from previous editors. Besides the readings approved by
himself, which he distinguishes by the word “leg.,'’ Bentley 1166 added
in the same copy of Parcus 6 collation of the most important variants of
the Oodex Britannicus, 86 which he had access as keeper 61 the Royal
Library 68 St. J ames'. These have some value, not only as showing the
respect that Bentley had for this MS, but because they were copied before
the MS. suffered in the fire which burnt the Cottonian Library (1731),
