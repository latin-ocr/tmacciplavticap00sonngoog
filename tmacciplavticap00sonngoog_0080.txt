traces of the fire arc visible3 but this folio has suffered far less than
the average amount of damage, and therefore gives no idea of the
trouble which it costs to deeipher the writing in some of the worst
places. Of the first folio, for instance (the commencement of the
Amphitruo), nothing remains but a small fragment of parchment
from the contre. The general character of the writing points to
the and of the llth century, our MS. is therefore probably some-
what younger than the Codex Vetus, and somewhat older than the
’ Codex Ursinianus.

That so ancient aMS. could not be valueless was a priori prohable3
and indeed no doubts as to its importance seem ‚to have existed
among scholare until recent years, though it was at no time widely
known and apparently never collated. That Bentley both knew and
valued it, has been sufficiently proved in my Preface 3 if further
proof were needed, I might cite a passage from his edition of Terence
(Haut11. 20), in which he quotes a reading of a MS. which he
calls ‘Codex Regius 800 annorum' doubtless meaning J, which has
the reading in question* Our MS. appears, however, to have been
known' long before the time of Bentley. In his interesting article on Ι
the ‘ Plautina Studies of Camerarius’ (Opuse. 111 p. 117 )‚'Ritsohl
conjecturesthat J is the MS. which Camerarius hoped would be sent
to him from England. He quotesa letter of Melanchthon to Carne·
rarius, June loth, 1538, from which it appears that the former had
been in correspondenee with an English bishop on the subject ,
“ De Plauto accurate scripsi ad Episcopum quendam Anglicum, et
ad Franciscum nostmm, qui cum tuo vetere amieo Bammelbergio ¹
in Britanniam missus cst, ut audiant Bagis voluntatem de religione.’'
It is supposed that the ‘Episcopus quidam Anglicus’ was Thomas
Cranurer. Camerarius’ hopes were doubtless disappointed; for his
‘Epistola Nuneupatoria' makes no mentiones his having received
the MS: hedit actually been sent, he would certainly have ex7
pressed his obligations to the senders. But thatJ is the MS. in
questionis sufficiently proved by the fact that there neither is nor
ever was, so far as is known, any other MS. of Plautus in Englaud
which can date back further than the loth century.

Bitsehl, too, was originally inclined, as has been stated above, to
place J upon an equality with B and D. His words are: “ex
illarum codiced (the supposed archetype) repetendi Bet D, quorum
binas partes ex eis quae supra attulimus intelligitur seorsum scriptas
esse: repetendus J, qui est membraneus Musei Britannici 15. oxi,
rectius autem ut opinor undecimo quam decimo saeculo tribuitur.”
With this passage should be compared his stemma, p. xxxvii He
seems, however, never to have seen the MS„ and to have had little
knowledge of it at this time3 for in the article quoted above (Opusc.
111 p. 119) he admits that he has changed his opinion asto its impert Ι
anae since receiving a collation of it by Emil Braun, and becoming

(Ι *t That Bentley was mistaken in the age of J has been pointed out by Wagner
n r. pp. 111, iv .
