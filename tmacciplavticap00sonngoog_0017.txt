raurici ro unu rnummrnar EDITION.

In preparing an edition of a play of Plautus lor the use of
my pupils in the Humanity Classes of the University of Glas-
gow it has been my aim to put into their hands not merely a
commentary which should serve as an introduction to the
study of Plautus, but also a text founded upon the best MS.
authority available, and cognizant of recent labours in the field
'of Plautina criticism. No edition of Plautus seemed to me to
meet these requirements so well as that of Dr. Julius Brix,

Parcus (2nd edition, Frankfort, 1623). The collation of the
Codex Britannicus Ihave myself made. It would certainly
have been desirable to add aoollation of the Codex Ursinianus
(D), which contains the first 500 lines of the play3 hut I had
