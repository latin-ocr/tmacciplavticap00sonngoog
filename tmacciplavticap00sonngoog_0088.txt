pendently. But 11110111010011 01 001, 011 Bentley’e corrections havea
value3 itis worth while 10 know which 01 the emendatione 01 010-
vious editors he approved 3 and some of the suggestions 01 10010
modern scholare receive 0 new and important confirmation from 1110
fact that they were long ago made by the founder 01 conjectural 01111-
01010. The general reader, 100, may acquire fresh confidente 10 the
methods 01 conjectural emendation 01 ancient texts 11010 00 00011110-
ing a 01001 that in 0 large number 01 cases they lead independent
critice to identical results; and possibly 0100 the general impressiou
current in England, that Bentley was in the habit 01 dealing sorne-
what reckleesly with Ms. authority, may receive some modification
when it is found that hie criticiem anticipatee, as it were at 0 blow,
much 01 the results 01 modern investigation.

In extracting Bentley's emendatione, Ι have proceeded 011 the 0100
01 interpreting his signs and giving the reeult; thus, where Bentley
writes l 2 in the margin, and indicates by a curved line the words
10 be transposed, 111ον0 written tha words in the new order; where
Bentley writes dcl. in the margin, and pute dote under the lettere 10
be deleted, Ihave given the word as 110 meant 10 read it In all
cases the word 01 words 01 Parcus which he correcte are given on
1110101101 sequere bracket, hie correction appearing on 1110 right.
But 1 heve 0010100 possible avoided making any change, even 01

the minutest character, which Bentley’e signs do 001 11011001, even
¹ though itis perfectly clear that Bentley himself would have made
some further alteration had he written the word 01 sentence out in

full, instead 01 merely indicating the correction to be made. Thus
where Parcus printe a substantive witha capital, apparently 1011011-
’ ing the usage 01 German, and Bentley, in making some 011101 001-
1001100 10 1110 word, does not take the trouble 10 0011001 the capital,
Ihave allowed it 10 stand 00 1110 right 01 the bracket 0100. In
certain caece, indeed, it has been impossible to carry this out with
absolute consistency 3 where Parcus for instance gives ejclrrtf, and
Bentley deletes the e, I have of course written aibat, not cjhot ; so
where he correcte claci by deleting the 0, Ι have given clai, not elci.
Agaiu, when a capital in Parcus indicates the beginning 01 0 0011
sentence arliae, and Bentley changes the order 01 1110 words without
expressly altering the 0001101, 11 00010οἀ best 1011110 sake 0101001·-
neceto made the slight further change; thus Epo tc would, if trans-
posed, appear as Te 000. Where Bentley removes a whole word
’11001 1110 text, my plen hae been 10 write the word,„togctlrer with ¹
that imnrcdiatelyprecediug 01· following it, on the 101101 1110 bracket,
and 10 1000011110 101101010οθ 00 the right. Thus in Epid. 1 2. 23,
