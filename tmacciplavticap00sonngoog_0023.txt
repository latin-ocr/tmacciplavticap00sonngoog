SOURC‘ES OF THE ΤΕΧΤ. xv

where their emendations have been also enrbodied in the text,
An exception to this rule is made in the case of the readings
of Bentley, here published for the first time (see Preface)‚
which are always quoted, whether adopted or not. But in
all cases in which the text does not contain the reading of
oria of the MSS. B or J, the source of the reading adopted is
indicated, sometimes hy the words θοοὶ. Min, where it rests
upon MS. authority of secundary importance‚ sometimes by
the name of its proposer‚ if it is a oonJecture3 or if this is
not done, the inference tube drawn is, that the correction is ‘
one of some antiquity, and generally accepted in all editions*
The words or letters printed in italics in the text, indicate a
eonJ'ectural addition, nothing corresponding to which is found
in the MSS. Asa rule‚ it is not intended in the Apparatus
to give information as to whether a reading is tc be found
or not in other editions than that in which it was originally
proposed ; all that is pointed out is the source lnam which it
comes. But here again I have made an exception in the case
of Bentley's emendations3 and in all cases in which the cor-
rection has been independently made, since his time, by some
other commentator, Ι have added the name of the latter as
well. Two names also appear attached to a reading where
Bentley’s correction is identical with one proposed by some
previous editor.

ὓ Again, where the question is one of orthography, or of rearrange-
ment of lines, Ι have not always referred the correction to its author.
