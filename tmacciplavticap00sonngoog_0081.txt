better acquainted with it from other sources3 aad he adds, that had
Camerarius bean able 16 use it, it would have been of little use to
him by tha side 61 the Codex Vetus

Ι1· was Wagner, however, who first controverted the traditional

opinion of this MS. His line 61 argument is as follows: firstly, 116 ’

points out the frequent agreement 0f J with late MSS, such aa the
‘Pallebant' of Parcus, the Langieni, etc.; seeondly, ha charges J
with 1116 fatal defeat 61 beinga “corrected copy ;” thetis 16 say,
he maintains that the copyist did 1161 confine himself to copying,
but emended the text as he went on, according to his own judgment.
This would of course sariously impair 1116 valae 61 the Ms.; for
however faulty the archetype may have been, its 611616 would, as
Wagner says, have been “ 6616 weleome 16 116 111611 the emenda-
tions of 611 ignorant mediaeval grammarian.'' In proof 61 his 61616
ment, Wagner relies upon two arguments: (1) a number of passages
which he quotes from the Aulularia, in which he maintains that
such corrections have been made iu J 3 (2) 61161 quoting the 1161-
barous verses which 616 appended 16 the MS. on the last folio,
aud which run as follows,

ι Exemplar mendum taudem me compulit ipsum
Cunctantem nimium plautum exemplarier istum
Ne graspicus mendis proprias idiota repertis
Ad deret. et liber bic 16166 patre falsior erret,

he adds, that they must he admitted to “contain truth :'’ and he
seems 16 understand tham to mean that the scribe emended the text
in order to improve an ‘exemplar mendum' 61 faulty archetype. Ι
shall have 16 16111111 16 these verses; but will not discuss their
meaning he're, 111 order to bring up 1116 61161611 of 1116 6611116161611 to
the present time. .

Wagner's attaek was followed up by an anonymous writer in the
Philologiseher Anzeiger (1872, p. 391), who maintained 11161 even
the opinion 61 Wagner was 'too favourable to J, and that on the
ground 61 tha “fatal agreement'’ of J with minor MSS, it must be
elassed together with them, aad all referred to one and 1116 same
source.

01111118, however, has found a defendes in G. (rotz, one of the
editors whais contiuuing the edition of Plautus commeneed by
Ritscbl. His view of 116 value is based upon 6116661116166611611611,1
and is stated iu his Analecta Plautina (Leipsic, 1877), bis Preface
16 the Epidicus (Leipsic, 1878), and an article in the Rheinisches
Museum (1879, p. 52 seq.). His position is shortly this: that the
evidence produced by Wagner to prove that J is a corrected copy,
by no means 116616 6111 such an assertion, although a passage may
here aud there be found in which 1116 hand 61 6661166161 ean 116

’ ⁴* 1 may state that 1 have examined the passages inwhich he notes a divergence
between this 6611611611 aud that 61 Wagner (Auel. Pl. p. 73), inall 6111166 1116
6611611611 61 umil Braun is quite accurate. ·
