writer 01 the lines wishes to say that in every diflicult passage he

has been absolutely faithful to the copy before him, and that he is
competent to the task The preservation, 00 characteristic 01 J, 01 ,
the old way 01 writing enclities and proclities‚ namcly, as part 01
the word to which they belong, coufirms the belief 11101 these state-
ments are true*

But the 100110 10 these lines make it evident that the MS. is not
the copy made hythe composer 01111001. J 00111101 0101111 10 be more
than a copy of that copy, and may he even a still later reproduction.
This is a fact which 0001110 altogether te have escaped Wagner. Yet
nothing can be olearer than that 0100011000 101 prophaetae, and adderet
for 0011101011, 010 the mistakes 01 just such an “ idiota graphicus” 00
the versifier 1001011 10 01111001 with the task of copying Plautus. The
traces ef 1110 carelessness and ignorance of the scribe of J are visible
on every folio of the MS„ which seems often to have been written
with utter disregard 01 00000 and metro—indeed in total indiffer-
ence as to whether the letters put down formed aLatin word 01
not. Thus we find such combinations of letters 00 innunt (11. 13)
for uiuunt, to which when written it certainly bears acertain resem-
blance, 10011 (i. e. locunt) 10110011 (rw 2. 38), 1010110010 1011001101
(12. 10), dr for ecc two or three times, 0111111011 101 uilitate (11
1. 37), 1100110100 101 duellatores (Prol. 68), 0010000111 for 0010 quom
(lv 2. 120), and so on in almost every decen lines; in 11 3. 54, the
MS. reads Fecisti 101 Feci, copying the first word of 51, and owing
to a similar mistake it omits altogether a line, Aul. 111 2. 12, which
ends with the same words (capnt 000111) as the line before. Many
other instancea 01 such emissione, sometimes 01000, sometimes 01
twa, once 01 1001111100 (Epid. 1 l. 84 seq.)‚ 010 quoted by Gb'tz
(Auel. Pl. p. 73 seq.). Agant, the marks 01 contractione indicating
achange 01 speakers 010 thrown in with the greatest carelessness,
and in such away as 10 make the dialogue often quite unintelligible
(see 0010 00 p. 17) 3 thus in v l. 32, 11 essigns the words Sequere
-intro to Philocrates, making him 1110 speaker and the person
addressed attha same time. All this negligence no doubt renders
J a 1000 perfect 001101 it would otherwise 1101011000, but at any
1010 we are 0010 11010 the hand 01 0001100101 here; and, as I have
tried to show, there is no reason 10 suspect it iu the first copyist.
The MS. we 01 present possess is therefore a bad copy 01 an exact
copy 01 0 faulty archetype. ⁴

In using J we must therefore be prepared to find the text fre·
quently disfigured and distorted3 but we are also entitled to expect
from aMs. of the llth century that it should afford us some real
help in constituting the text 3 and this, I think it does. ln spite
of the general and marked superiority 01 Β, J in not a few passages

⁸* l'races 01 the same spelling are found also in B ,· see Ritschl, Proleg. 11111.

cpo3 0011111001 therefore suppose 1110 hare bean employed in the common archetype
0 an .
