0116, which is then undarlined also. The precise meaning 01 61110
sign is not quite clear; 10110113 I took it to denote approval 01 the
line 0111016 as it stands iu the text 01 Ρο10110, 0116 this interpreta-
tion seems to be borne out by Epid. rv 2. 33, where he puts his tick
60 the word equidem in the text, adding in the margin asecond tick
and the letters Ma: this should mean that equidem is the reading
01 J, 0116 so in fact it 10. In order, however, 60 avoid the danger
01 reading my own inferences into Bentley’s corrections, I have
simply represented the tick by 06 00 6110 right 01 the bracket, 1116
applies to a part only 01 the line, Ι have added 61106 part on the 1016.
The numbers 01 the lines in this Appendix are those 01 Parcus 3
wherever the Vulgata (Gronovius, 1669, 1684) has a different
number, Ι have added itin square brackets. ,111 0160160 facilitate

study Bentlcy's emendations 111 connection with tha text 01 Ρο10110;
11116 11 this book cannot be obtained, the text 01 6110 Vulgata is
generally sufficiently 1100160 16 60 make Bentley's corrections iutel-
ligible. Parcus, on the whole, follows 6110 Codex Vetus (B) very
closely.
· Another part 016110 Appendix contains the words which I
bave restored 60 J from Bentley’s 0011061011 01 the MS. 3 00011060 60
Ρ101. p. vi (11). On the whole, the result 60 be arrived at in this way
issomewhat disappointing, except in the Amphitruo. This is 110
doubt partly due to the fact 61106 Bentley's 0011061011 was never
intended to be complete3 attha same 6111101 think I have noticed
that precisely where the MS. is now destroyed, Bentley's 0011061011
becomes 11100310 01 0000003 0116 Iam inclined to conjecture that the
Ma. hadsuffered some other injury before Bentley collated 160116
was partly illegible in his time. Another and more serious objection
may be made to any results arrived at 111 this way—that Bentley is
not entirely accurate. I have 11061006 the following passages in
which his 0011061011 10 11110Ιο061113 01 wrong: in Amph. Ρ101. 95,J
